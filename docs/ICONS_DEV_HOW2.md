## Tutorial

Let's say you're making a plugin and want to use an icon of a train. Since the Discord mobile app doesn't have one, you use a custom icon like this:

| Example Train Icon             |
| ------------------------------ |
| ![Train Icon](./TrainIcon.png) |

```jsx
<Image
  source={{
    uri: "data:image/png;base64,...",
  }}
/>
```

> [!TIP]
> Most redesigned Discord icons use #4E5058 as their tint color

This works, but the icon can't be themed using an iconpack. To do that, you must add `width`, `height` and `path` properties to your icon object, like this:

```jsx
<Image
  source={{
    uri: "data:image/png;base64,...",
    width: 72,
    height: 72,
    path: "YourAwesomePlugin/TrainIcon.png",
  }}
/>
```

> [!TIP]
> You should follow Discord's icon naming scheme, PascalCase description of object ending with Icon (TrainIcon)

And lastly, set `allowIconTheming` to `true`, like so:

```jsx
<Image
  source={{
    uri: "data:image/png;base64,...",
    width: 72,
    height: 72,
    path: "YourAwesomePlugin/TrainIcon.png",
    allowIconTheming: true,
  }}
/>
```

And you're done! Iconpack makers can now change the icon by editing the file at `<iconpack root>/_/external/YourAwesomePlugin/TrainIcon.png`.
